By debugging I found out that the second print gives numbers that when they are executed in the functions cause t1 to be 0.
Then it divides t0 / t1 producing a ZerDivisionError. Is as simple as that.

The error is in the line 11 , inside the function.
This happens when c and d take the same value of function f.
